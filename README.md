<h1> Restaurant Chatbot hosted on AWS Cloud </h1>

<h3> What is this project? </h3>

This is personal project that I made to showcase my skills in cloud computing. Throughout this project, I used a variety of services that include: Lex, Lambda, S3, Cloudwatch and IAM. Furthermore I showcased my skills in basic web development by creating a static website to serve as a menu. Once I had completed creating the chatbot, I then integrated it onto the static website so that customers can view the menu and place an order using the chatbot on a centralized platform. 

<h3> What problems am I solving? </h3>

1. __Reducing wait times:__ <br>
   The chatbot's biggest factor in improving customer service is reducing wait times. Many small businesses simply do not have enough staff to answer customer calls at any given moment. During holiday seasons or even just weekends, restaurants receive a high volume of takeout orders. The restaurant chatbot solves all these issues by providing customers with a centralized platform to view the menu and place their orders.

2. __Reducing Operational Costs__ <br>
   Small businesses often operate on tight budgets. The chatbot reduces the need for extra staff by handling customer inquiries, reservations, and orders automatically. It works 24/7, ensuring customers get responses even when the restaurant is closed.

3. __Eliminating human error__ <br>
   The restaurant chatbot significantly reduces human error, which is a common challenge in fast-paced food service environments. It does this by ensuring order-taking accuracy, eliminating manual data entry errors, standardize customer interactions (make sure any promotions are mentioned), and avoids reservation conflicts.
   
4. __Enhancing efficiency__ <br>
   Staff can fully focus their time on serving in-store customers and maximizing takeout order efficiency.

5. __Multilingual Support__ <br>
   If the restaurant serves diverse customers, the bot can communicate in multiple languages.
